# HappyQuest
A cordova mobile app focused on making people more productive. Part of my 6 apps in 6 months project.

The point is to:
1) set a focus period length (20-90 minutes)
2) set a goal for the period
3) evaluate if you met the goal or not at the end

This app was developed using the SCARF prinicples (mainly the C for certainty) and pomodoro technique and Get Things Done technquies.

TODO : Add sticky refactoring that I use on my kanban boards to allow the user to leverage new insights and express the portion of work complete and the portion of work outstanding.
